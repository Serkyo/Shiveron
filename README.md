## Features
- Moderation commands (ban, kick, timeout, purge, etc.)
- Temporary voice channels with a menu allowing users to change the properties of their own voice channel
- Stores user infractions in a dedicated database
- Allows moderators to quickly view a user's infraction history
- And much more to come!

## Public Hosted Version
You can invite the public version of Shiveron using [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1305623177753526282&permissions=8&integration_type=0&scope=applications.commands+bot).  
The bot is hosted by me, and I try to ensure it stays up 24/7.

## Requirements
- **Discord Bot Token** : Available from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) under the "Bot" tab
- **Discord Client ID** : Found in the "General Information" tab of the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- **Docker** : Download from the [official website](https://www.docker.com)

## Installation

### 1. Creating a Discord Bot Application
If you haven't already, create a Discord application at the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).  
Then, create a bot account within the application and reset its token to copy it.

To invite your bot to a server :
- Go to the **OAuth2** tab
- Under **OAuth2 URL Generator**, check `application.commands` and `bot`
- In the **permissions** section, check `Administrator`
- Copy the generated link and open it in your browser to invite the bot to your server

### 2. Installing and Running Shiveron
Once your bot is ready, follow these steps :
- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Serkyo/Shiveron/releases)
- Extract the files from the downloaded archive
- The following step differs depending on your os :
  - **Linux users :** Run the file `linux_setup_and_run.sh` **in your terminal** by typing the following after navigating to the directory where you extracted the bot files :
    ```bash
    chmod +x linux_setup_and_run.sh
    ./linux_setup_and_run.sh
    ```
  - **Windows users :** I couldn't make a working script to run the bot, so you'll have to do it manually. Don't worry, it's not that deep. First, simply fill in the required fields of the file `.env.example`, and then rename it to `.env`. You simply have to do the following commands to start and stop the bot :
    ```cmd
    docker compose up -d --build
    docker compose stop
    ```

## Adding Features
Shiveron provides an easy-to-use API, allowing developers to create or modify its features. You must first install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/fr/download), and then install all the project dependencies :
```bash
- npm install
```
Now, you can start coding ! Here's what you can change easily :
- **Commands** : Stored in `src/commands/` under subfolders by category. Remove a feature by simply deleting the file. Add a new one by creating a TypeScript file with a class extending `BaseCommand`.
- **Events** : Stored in `src/events/`. Remove a feature by deleting the file or commenting out its function call in the `execute` method. Add a new event by creating a TypeScript file extending `BaseCommand` and filling in all required fields, especially the event name (refer to the [official Discord.js documentation](https://discord.js.org/docs/packages/discord.js/14.24.2/ClientEvents:Interface)).
